          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class="intro">I became interested in game development thanks to a game called Trials Evolution. I used the games editor to create
             and publish many challenging levels which were well received by the Trials community.</p>

            <h3>Digital Art</h3>
            <p>Drawing and painting have been a part of my life since I was a child but recently I got into digital art when a friend approached me with
               an idea for a mobile game. We came together and designed a game that was successfully deployed to the Android marketplace.
               I have been creating digital art ever since.</p>

            <h3>Playing Soccer</h3>
            <p>I was born playing football, just kidding but i've loved the sport for a very long time. 
               These days i only juggle and kick around for fun because a couple years ago I fractured my ankle while playing.</p>
